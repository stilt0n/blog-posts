# Totally Speculative Job Advice

It seems like one of the basic requirements of being a programmer is having the irritating need to give everyone who has touched a computer career advice. I don't know exactly how it works out this way, because I didn't exactly get asked for career advice in any of my interviews. But someone must have put two and two together and realized that I am exactly the sort of prick who would write an obnoxious blog post giving out advice. The rest is history. But that's enough intro.

## 1. No one knows shit about this

I have a programming job. Guess how many past programming jobs I've had? Zero. Worst case, I've had one more than you. Want to know the secret to how I got my job?

I went to college for CS, did some career fairs, got an internship, and got an offer through that.

This is somehow simultaneously too vague and too specific to be useful. But we can generalize some lessons if we dig deeper right?

You're reading a blog post with career advice. This unfortunately means we can't do this the easy way so, sure, let's dive deeper. 

Having a personal project helped during the interview in my case. Me and the interviewing engineer talked about my project most of the time. Then we ran out of time and he had to give me a lowball "two queues with a stack" question. Usually people call this luck. My project wasn't even that cool. It was a reskin of a Udemy project (the type of project everyone says will never impress anyone). I even *told my interviewer this* and it was still sufficient just to talk through the technical details.

But why would *your* interview go like this? Why would any of *my* other interviews go like this?

For all you know you'll be asked to implement JDSL using nothing but a whiteboard marker and office toilet paper. Also the office is out of toilet paper and, yes, they are blaming that on you.

In reality technical interviews are usually pretty predictable so you can prepare for them. So the point isn't that you can't know anything. But rather that most of the things you can know are the kinds of obvious things you don't need to read career advice blog posts to learn about. And most of the "hacks" (e.g. "have a project to talk about and you'll get an easy interview") are situation specific and unreliable.

## 2. Data is for idiots

You think you're *so* clever because you looked up some stats about job postings in your area and decided to fit your skill set to those. I've got bad news for you: you're doing data-driven astrology. Better hope you're not aiming for data scientist!

This seems like it should be obvious but it turns out that data is the achilles heel of many engineering types and a surprising amount of people see data as a substitute for thinking rather than a compliment to it.

I'm not saying that's *you*. But for sake of argument let's say that's *you*.

Okay, so you've searched listings on Indeed and have found that Java Spring Boot is #1 in your area. So obviously you should focus on Java right? Not so fast Einstein! How "hard" or "easy" it is to get a job depends on a lot more than volume of job postings on Indeed.

Some of you may be extra clever and already know this. *Of course* you're also going to factor in how many people are competing for the job openings.

You're on the right track but are vastly oversimplifying the problem. Let's break this down into two categories. "Open jobs" and "competitors". Now let's look at those:

**Open Jobs**
- How many jobs are there total for a tech?
- How many jobs are there for adjacent techs that are willing to hire people who know this tech instead?
- How many of those jobs fit your experience level?
- How many of those jobs are real, up to date, job listings?

**Competitors**
- How many people say they know that tech?
- How many people *actually* know it enough to have a chance in hell at being called back?
- How many people are trying for the jobs that fit your skill level?
- How many people have adjacent skills that employers see as roughly substitutable?

So please explain why your quick search on Indeed is even remotely valuable. When you say "mern stack is oversatured" is it because you have actual evidence for this or because you've gone on reddit and mistaken a bunch of "mern stack devs", who couldn't write a `<p>` tag without copying it from ChatGPT, for competition. I'm not saying it *isn't* oversaturated. I'm just saying it's often hard to really determine what is and isn't.

But it gets worse.

It turns out that the stupidest strategy for getting a job (besides not trying) is to do nothing but send cold applications on indeed/linkedin. And everything we discussed above is most relevant for that strategy. You're not really gonna just do the stupid strategy are you?

If you answered "no" to the last question then there's more to think about. e.g.

- Are there local communities where you might be able to make meaningful professional connections?
- Are you better suited for one type of company (e.g. startups) that tends to favor tools that diverge from the average?

Let's say you're a self taught beginner and you're trying to find a small, forward thinking company that will take a risk on an unconventional candidate. Meanwhile you've chosen to optimize your skill set to writing enterprise-style Java because that's what you see on most job postings. Did you actually think this would help you land a job at a small, cutting edge startup? Good luck passing their enterprise-style drug test!

The core of the problem here is that you're trying to figure out what the average best path to a job is and then use it as a stand-in for what *your* best path to a job is. And then on top of it all you're ignoring the fact that markets change quickly and skill aquisition takes time.

Data isn't entirely useless. You're not gonna get a job as a brainfuck developer. But if you're leaning heavily on this kind of data to make key life decisions then please, for the love of god, make better life decisions.

If you find something you like working with, make sure a reasonable amount of people use it and go with it. It's really that easy.

## 3. Resumes

Okay, let's talk about resumes for a bit. Stop me if you've head this one before:

Some desperate chump (you) is looking for resume writing advice and comes across some foul creature on LinkedIn saying shit like "be concise and keep things to one page" but this same jackass gives you an example resume (after you've given them your email for marketing purposes) that fills its precious one page of space with word salad like:

> Leveraged the power of ECMAScript to create beautiful, user-friendly, seamless User Interfaces (UIs) that delivered value to stakeholders by increasing key vanity metrics by 26%

I shouldn't even have to tell you this is the *last* person you should take advice from on literally any topic. But I see so many resumes that have taken this person's advice. I've even met one guy who *paid a resume writer to write this shit for him*. (Next time you feel pathetic, remember that.) So it's clear that I *do* have to tell you: 

What the fuck is wrong with you?!?

Stop reading this.

Go look over your resume right now.

Did you write something like this?

Here's what you need to do:

- Rewrite it immediately
- Burn all existing physical copies
- Send apology letters to anyone you made read this
- Apologize to whatever gods you believe in.
- Throw in a few you don't believe in to be safe.

Done? Good.

Look, I don't know a lot about resumes. I'm not a recruiter. I'm not a hiring manager. But this is a "play stupid games win stupid prizes" kind of situation. What if this lunatic really *did* get a job with a resume worded like that? Are you prepared to work in an office full of other people just like shit-for-brains? It's not worth it.

There's a lot of audiences you need to optimize for. Applicant tracking systems, recruiters, hiring managers, fellow engineers, etc. So getting a perfect resume has got to be a careful balancing act. And even a perfect resume is going to be at the mercy of luck because the powers that be can't even agree on what they want to see. I've read an article by a recruiter where they claim that using "I" instead of "we" is a sign you're not a team player. I've read another article by a recruiter that says using "we" instead of "I" shows your role was minimal and should be dismissed. The author's opinion? Reading into small differences in wording makes you a goddamn schizo.

Most people who managed to get jobs don't have a perfect resume. They're probably too busy doing their job to be even half as obsessed in the ins-and-outs of applicant tracking systems as you are. So just write something reasonable and then stop trying to optimize for the wrong things.

## 4. What should I do?

So now we're at the part of the article where I have to try to spoon-feed you something actionable to avoid complaints by nitwits who can't work out what to do on their own.

Recall what we talked about at the start:

- No one knows shit (this includes me)
- You shouldn't assume advice you get from strangers on the internet applies to your situation
- You shouldn't assume advice you get from strangers on the internet applies in *any* situation

But you came all this way so here it is:

**Stop focusing so hard on getting a job.**

To be clear, I'm not saying don't focus on it at all. You should try to have good habits about this stuff:

- Apply for jobs on a reasonably regular basis
- Go out and meet people sometimes
- Take a bit of time each week to improve your interview skills

But then focus on something else. *Anything* else. Very few things perform worse than making micro-optimizations to your resume or trying to interpret noisy and irrelevant job posting data.

Given how useless this kind of micro-optimization is, even just taking a break will serve you better. People who take breaks are easier to talk to than people who spend all day worrying about the minute details of applicant tracking systems. People who take breaks are also less likely to get burnt out. You might be in this for a while, so you're going to want to avoid burnout.

If you want to do a little better, then consider spending some of your time working on something that excites you. This will make you better at programming and more interesting to the people whose opinions really count. You also get cool projects you can show off.

But it's not just your own projects either.

Every programmer hears that working on open source is a great career move at some point in their life. And I'm pretty sure this is true. But making your first open source contribution is actually pretty daunting. I am not the most prolific open source contributor out there, but I've made a few contributions and some have been easier than others.

The easiest way I've found so far is to pick bleeding edge tools I find interesting and use them in my projects. Since they are new you will run into more problems. And when you run into problems you can create bug reports, help fill gaps in documentation or even contribute code to fix whatever came up.

It's hard to overstate how much easier this is with bleeding edge tools than popular tools that show up in most job ads. This is another shortcoming of trying to shortcut things using job data.

If you have your own cool projects or make open source contributions you can put this on your resume and, more importantly, talk about it with the people you meet. I can't promise this will help most of the time. But it will help a little of the time. And that's a lot better than most advice you'll receive.
