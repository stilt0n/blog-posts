# You Don't Need to Scale Alignment

## Scout bees

Once a year, between late spring and early summer, bee colonies begin to rear new queens. When this happens, the colony splits in two. The old queen leaves with several thousand bees to find a new nest and the new queen stays behind and takes over the current one. This process⸺called swarming⸺is remarkably complex and involves adjusting food intake, coordinating departure, choosing a nest site, and, crucially, steering the swarm to the new home. [[1]](#endnotes)

Let's take a closer look at steering the swarm. After a nest site has been chosen, it's time to move the entire swarm of bees to their new home. Here's the catch: only 3-4% of the bees⸺known as scout bees⸺know where the new nest site is. Despite this, the entire swarm is able to successfully navigate to its new home.

If you're at all familiar with bees, you might remember that they communicate chemically by using pheromones. So maybe scout bees use pheromones to give instructions to all the other bees? The answer, it turns out, is no. Even when experimenters disable the bees' ability to release pheromones, the scout bees manage to guide the swarm to their new home.

Bee swarm navigation is likely to be an example of *emergent behavior*. By following a small set of local rules, all the bees in a bee swarm are able to navigate to a new location without the need to communicate, and without even 5% of the bees having any clue where they are headed.

## Organizations are systems

The term *emergent behavior* comes from complexity science and the mental models from complexity science are often referred to under the umbrella of *systems thinking*.

One of the hallmarks of systems thinking is that a system is much more than the sum of its parts. As the parts of a system interact, the interactions cause behaviors to emerge out of the system itself. Bee swarm navigation is a very clear example of this. Somewhere around 96% of the bees have no clue where they are going. If we looked at just the components of the swarm (i.e. the bees) we should expect the swarm to be hopelessly lost. But when we also factor in the interactions between those bees we find that the *system* of bees is perfectly capable of navigating itself.

Human organizations are also prime examples of systems. And like bee swarms the behavior of a human organization can be confusing when it is only viewed as the sum of its parts. This confusion often gets in the way of a leader's ability to steer their organization.

A common claim I see in management books is that, in order for an organization to be most effective, leadership needs to *align* everyone in the organization to focus on common priorities. A sometimes spoken assumption that goes along with this is that the majority of the people in an organization need to be on the same page in order for the organization to be properly aligned.

This confuses the system with its parts. The direction of an organization is not determined by the equal effort of all its members. Instead, a small number of highly engaged individual contributors act like scout bees to steer the organization.

## Human scout bees and dark matter developers

I have a coworker who I will call "Bob" who exemplifies this.

Bob is a senior developer and has been at our company for around a decade. Throughout his career, Bob has frequently volunteered for projects and as a result he has touched many areas of our company and his opinions are well respected by a disparate group of developers and managers.

I am also a developer, but I am still early in my career and have not had time to build up a reputation like Bob's.

For the purposes of this essay, let's create a character for me and call him "Matt".

Bob and Matt work on several projects together. Through discussions, Bob became interested in one of Matt's favorite books on software development. Matt keeps a copy of it in his office, so when Bob expressed interest Matt lent the book to him.

Since then, Bob has read the book and become an advocate for many of Matt's favorite ideas from the book. He has discussed the book and related ideas in technical leadership meetings and the combined recommendation from Matt and Bob convinced their team's director Jen to read the book as well.

While Matt was the person who initiated this, the reason it has spread so far is because it got picked up by Bob who is very influential in the organization.

In network theory, we can say that Bob has *high degree centrality* in our organization's *social network*. Matt's connection to Bob may also give him a notable amount of *eigenvector centrality* in our organization's social network. But let's avoid network jargon from now on and refer to Bob and Matt as *scout bees* instead.

Just like scout bees make up only a small part of a bee swarm, Bob and Matt are not typical software developers. Bob and Matt are scout bees because they actively exert influence on the direction their organization is going. But the vast majority of developers aren't actively exerting this kind of influence. Most developers are [dark matter developers](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99) and like dark matter, the unobserved stuff that makes up most of the universe, dark matter developers make up most of your organization and are quietly performing most of its work. [[2]](#endnotes)

Let's create an archetypal dark matter developer named Gus. Gus typically focuses on the work assigned to him and the behavior of those around him. He cares about doing a good job, but he's not in the business of proactively innovating. Gus would prefer to passively absorb innovation from the scout bees around him over generating it himself.

But because Gus looks to those around him for cues his behavior will ultimately be influenced by the behavior of the scout bees.

## Putting things together

Jen has come up with new goals for her team and she wants to make sure that the team pushes those goals forward. Jen would like to do this as efficiently as she can.

If Jen follows the traditional model of alignment, she might hold an all-hands meeting to announce the new priorities. This may feel like an efficient way to scale communication to the entire organization, but the results are likely to be disappointing.

Most people at the meeting, like Gus, will be focused on their immediate work rather than Jen's new priorities. Gus will make an effort to care about the priorities, but when push comes to shove, he'll prioritize the tasks in front of him.

But since Gus' behavior is shaped by the influences around him, he can be steered indirectly by scout bees like Bob. In fact, Gus is unlikely to be oblivious to the credibility Bob has built up. And this credibility will tend to make Gus put more emphasis on Bob's opinion.

Does this mean Jen should just communicate with Bob?

Not really. People like Bob are the most influential but they're not the only way to influence the organization. They also may be hard to influence. Bob didn't get where he is by having weak opinions.

But we've already seen that people like Matt can also influence Bob. Matt makes a good ally for Jen in this situation because his technical background gives him a unique influence on Bob. And Matt is also likely to fill a role similar to Bob's in the future which makes developing rapport with him worthwhile.

This is not to say broad communications aren't valuable. They are. And while Gus might not be actively engaged, most people prefer not to be left completely in the dark. But broad communication is not sufficient to steer an organization and ultimately, Jen will be more effective if she focuses her energy on influencing the scout bees⸺those who are already driving the direction of the organization.

## What goes wrong with the traditional approach

Before going into how to steer an organization let's take a look at what goes wrong with the traditional approach.

The reason why the traditional approach goes wrong is because scout bees are a double-edged sword. Scout bees have strong intrinsic motivation and this causes them to steer the organization whether you want them to or not.

While scout bees care deeply about the organization, they have a limited perspective that is shaped by their own work. As a result, their influence can pull the organization in unintended directions.

Ideally, managers like Jen will have big picture context that can help guide scout bees in the right direction. But broad communications that try to please everyone can end up bland and irrelevant to those who are really steering the organization. 

Jen may reach a large number of people this way, but an organization is not the sum of its parts and by diluting her appeal to scout bees she risks losing most of her influence over the organization.

## Communicate in ways that don't scale

So what's the alternative? Paul Graham famously gives startup founders the advice to [do things that don't scale](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html). I think this approach is also the right way to steer an organization. This is because a small number of engaged contributors act like scout bees and are responsible for the bulk of steering.

So what does doing things that don't scale look like in this context? And how do you locate scout bees?

Let's start with finding scout bees. The first step in finding scout bees is to change how you do group communication. If you write a memo to your team, for example, then write it with a specific scout bee as your target audience. Chances are you know at least one Bob. What would he want to read about? Write about that.

Then encourage scout bees to engage with you. Make it clear that you're open to input on the future direction of the organization. Don't just say something vague like "I have an open door policy". Scout bees care deeply about your organization and they will reach out to you if you make it clear it won't be a waste of their time.

Then when someone reaches out, talk to them. These are the people who will shape your organization, so talking to them will always be a high-leverage activity.

The more that you talk with people like this, the more you will understand how to get them interested. And the more effectively you can communicate to scout bees, the more they can steer your organization on your behalf.

[[1]](#scout-bees): Scout bees are involved in many stages of this process do more than just navigate the swarm. Scout bees help coordinate the swarm's departure from the hive and they are also responsible for finding and choosing the new nest site. For interested readers, Thomas Seeley's book [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Honeybee-Democracy-Thomas-D-Seeley/dp/0691147213) is where I learned all this information and is a fascinating book that I highly recommend.
